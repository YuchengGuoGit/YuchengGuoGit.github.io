I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the Department of [https://orfe.princeton.edu/home Operations Research and Financial Engineering] at Princeton University. I am fortunate and grateful to be supervised by [https://www.cmu.edu/math/people/faculty/shkolnikov.html Prof. Mykhaylo Shkolnikov] and co-supervised by [https://sites.google.com/view/sergey-nadtochiy?pli=1 Prof. Sergey Nadtochiy]. My research touches upon stochastic analysis, partial differential equations, mathematical physics, mathematical finance, and machine learning. More specifically, I use probabilistic methods and interacting particle systems to analyze and solve problems that come from the above areas.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/ Fudan University] in 2021.
